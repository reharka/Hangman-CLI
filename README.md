# Hangman-CLI

Create a hangman command-line game using constructor functions.

Instructions:

The completed game should be able to receive user input using the inquirer or prompt npm packages.

Feel free to use as many different types of constructor functions as you are able to, but at a minimum, you must create the following constructor functions:

Word: Used to create an object representing the current word the user is attempting to guess. This should contain word specific logic and data.

Letter: Used for each letter in the current word. Each letter object should either display an underlying character, or a blank placeholder (such as an underscore), depending on whether or not the user has guessed the letter. This should contain letter specific logic and data.

You must keep track of the user's remaining guesses and prompt the user if they would like to end the game if none remain.

Each constructor function should be in it's own file and be exported and required wherever needed.

Look into function prototypes and use them for a few of your constructor's methods.
